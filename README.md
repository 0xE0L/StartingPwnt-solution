# StartingPwnt solution
Solution to the StartingPwnt challenge made by MaitreRenard (see https://github.com/MaitreRenard/StartingPwnt). \
My objective is to share it with newcomers so that they can become familiar with the basis of pwn / binary exploitation.

As for now challenges and solutions covers those 2 domains:
- Buffer overflows vulnerabilities: ROP chains, ret2libc, onegadgets.
- Format strings vulnerabilities.

For each challenge, I've made one or multiple scripts/approaches to solve it, so that you can see and learn different methods of solving.
Scripts have been abundantly commented so that beginners can understand what's going on.

All challenges have been solved in Python using the great PwnTools library.
